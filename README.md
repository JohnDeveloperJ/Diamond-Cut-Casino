## Infrastructure

Diamond-Cut- Cross-Chain Casino relies on a robust infrastructure that consists of three essential components to ensure fairness, transparency, and security:

### 1. Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)

MoonStar Casino requires randomness for its games, and this is achieved through an integrated Verifiable Random Function (VRF). A VRF serves as a Random Number Generator (RNG) that generates random outcomes that can be verified on the blockchain. This essential feature allows MoonStar Casino to provide users with provably fair results that are impossible to have been tampered with.

[Chainlink VRF](https://chain.link/vrf) is the industry's leading VRF provider in the crypto space, known for its reliability and security. It plays a vital role in ensuring that the games offered on MoonStar Casino are truly random and free from manipulation. If you're interested in understanding the inner workings of a VRF like Chainlink VRF, please refer to the documentation.

For insights into how MoonStar Casino integrates Chainlink VRF into its smart contracts, please explore the "Architecture" page in our documentation.

### 2. BankrollFacet Contract

The `BankrollFacet` contract is a fundamental part of our comprehensive smart contract system. This contract is responsible for managing funds and handling various functions related to gameplay, including payouts and player suspension. It acts as the financial backbone of our casino, ensuring a seamless and secure experience for our users.

### 3. Foundational Infrastructure

The bankroll and common contracts, along with other foundational components, serve as the backbone of your decentralized application (DApp). They are critical for the overall security, functionality, and management of MoonStar Cross-Chain Casino. These contracts play a pivotal role in handling user interactions, managing funds, and guaranteeing a fair and transparent gaming experience.
