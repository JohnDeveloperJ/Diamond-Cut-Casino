## The Foundation of Our Casino

At Diamond Cut Casino, we've established a robust foundation for our gaming ecosystem. Our system is powered by the Diamond Contract, utilizing the innovative upgrade pattern outlined in EIP-2535: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy. This contract serves as the central hub for managing bankroll funds, transactions, and payouts to players. To ensure secure and efficient operations, our bankroll takes cues from the immutable BankrollFacet Contract, which provides clear instructions for executing transactions. Furthermore, each of our Game Contracts maintains direct communication with the bankroll contract, allowing for seamless gameplay interactions. This foundation guarantees a smooth and transparent gaming experience for our players.

## The Pillars of Our Infrastructure

Diamond-Cut Cross-Chain Casino relies on a robust infrastructure composed of three key components to ensure fairness, transparency, and security:

### 1. Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)

Randomness is crucial for our games, and it's achieved through our integrated Verifiable Random Function (VRF). The VRF serves as a Random Number Generator (RNG) that generates random outcomes verifiable on the blockchain. This crucial feature enables us to offer provably fair results that are impossible to tamper with.

[Chainlink VRF](https://chain.link/vrf) is our trusted VRF provider, known for its reliability and security in the crypto space. It plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the games offered on Diamond-Cut Casino are truly random and free from manipulation. For a deeper understanding of the inner workings of VRF, such as Chainlink VRF, please refer to the documentation.

If you're curious about how Chainlink VRF integrates into our smart contracts, explore the "Architecture" page in our comprehensive documentation.

### 2. BankrollFacet Contract

The `BankrollFacet` contract is the backbone of our smart contract system. It's responsible for managing funds and overseeing various functions related to gameplay, including payouts and player suspension. This contract ensures a seamless and secure experience for our users by acting as the financial core of our casino.

### 3. Foundational Infrastructure

The bankroll and common contracts, along with other foundational components, are the pillars of our decentralized application (DApp). These contracts are critical for security, functionality, and overall management of Diamond-Cut Cross-Chain Casino. They play a pivotal role in handling user interactions, managing funds, and guaranteeing a fair and transparent gaming experience.
